
# 🛡️ Sentinel AI – Network Intrusion Detection System

Sentinel AI is a **network intrusion detection system (IDS)** powered by **Machine Learning**.  
It captures live network traffic, preprocesses packets, and detects anomalies (e.g., **DDoS, port scans**) in real time.  
The results are visualized on a **web dashboard** with charts for quick insights.

## 🚀 Features
- 📡 **Live Packet Capture** from network
- ⚙️ **Preprocessing** of raw traffic into structured datasets
- 🤖 **ML Model Detection** of anomalies (DDoS, Port Scan, etc.)
- 📊 **Real-time Dashboard** with line graphs & pie charts
- 📦 **Modular Architecture**: capture → preprocess → detect → visualize

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend & ML:** Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Chart.js
- **Networking:** Socket, Packet Capture (pcap tools)
- **Visualization:** Real-time charts and anomaly reports
